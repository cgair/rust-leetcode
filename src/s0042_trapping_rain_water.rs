/**
 * [42] Trapping Rain Water
 *
 * Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.
 *
 * The above elevation map is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. 
 * In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *
 * Input: [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
 * Output: 6
